# User Story: Resource Sharing / Mutualization

## Scenario: Two Organizations Sharing Equipment via an open source ERP

**Context**: Sensorica (a maker space) and FabLab (a fabrication lab) want to share a CNC machine through their traditional open source ERP platform integration with Nondominium. **This scenario represents Nondominium's core strength - bilateral resource sharing between organizations - with potential enhancement for broader equipment network optimization.**

See also *erp_holochain_bridge.md*

> **How to read this story (grounding note).** The CNC machine is an **NDO**: a permanent
> Layer 0 `NondominiumIdentity`, a Layer 1 `ResourceSpecification` with access
> `GovernanceRule`s (certified operators, insurance), and a Layer 2 `EconomicResource`
> instance whose `custodian` moves Sarah → Marco → Sarah and whose `OperationalState`
> cycles `Available → Reserved → InTransit → InUse` (lifecycle maturity stays on Layer 0).
> Custody handoffs use `transfer_custody`, which records a `TransferCustody` economic event
> and issues bilateral **PPRs** from the 16-category set: `CustodyTransfer` /
> `CustodyAcceptance` for the handoff, `TransportCommitmentAccepted` /
> `TransportFulfillmentCompleted` for Marco's transport service, and `GoodFaithTransfer`
> for the trust-based lend. Narrative labels like `UseService`, `ServiceValidation`,
> and `CommitmentFulfillment` are shorthand for these real `ParticipationClaimType`
> values. The ERP, mobile app, and REST API are the **Web2 host platform** (the
> Node.js bridge); steps against `ND` are the ValueFlows/governance zome calls.
> Organizational-agent delegation (org owns, employee holds custody) is **post-MVP**
> (see `specifications.md §6`); the MVP treats each participant as an individual agent.

## 🔄 Transaction Journey

### **Phase 1: Discovery & Intent (Day 1)**

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Marco as Marco (FabLab)
    participant ERP as ERP
    participant ND as Nondominium
    participant Res as Resource Zome
    participant Gov as Governance Zome

    Marco->>ERP: Search for CNC equipment
    ERP->>ND: get_all_economic_resources()
    ND->>Res: Query available resources
    Res-->>ND: Return CNC machine specs
    ND-->>ERP: Resource with governance rules
    ERP-->>Marco: Display CNC machine details

    Marco->>ERP: Review governance rules
    ERP->>ND: get_resource_specification_with_rules()
    ND->>Gov: Return rules (certification, insurance)
    Marco->>ERP: Submit AccessForUse commitment
    ERP->>ND: propose_commitment()
    ND->>Gov: Create commitment
```

**Sarah's Actions**:

1. **Resource Discovery**: Marco searches the ERP for available fabrication equipment
2. **Governance Review**: Marco reviews CNC machine's embedded governance rules:
   - Requires Transport certification ✅
   - Proof of facility insurance required
   - Minimum 48-hour notice for transport
3. **Intent Signaling**: Marco submits `AccessForUse` commitment through ERP interface

### **Phase 2: Validation & Trust Building (Day 2)**

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Sarah as Sarah (Sensorica)
    participant ERP as ERP
    participant ND as Nondominium
    participant PPR as PPR System

    ND->>Sarah: Notify of new commitment
    Sarah->>ERP: Review Marco's credentials
    ERP->>ND: derive_reputation_summary(Marco)
    ND->>PPR: Calculate reputation scores
    PPR-->>ND: Return reputation data (98% on-time, 4.8/5 quality)
    ND-->>ERP: Display Marco's reputation
    Sarah->>ND: validate_agent_for_custodianship()
    ND->>Gov: Create validation receipt
    Gov-->>ERP: Commitment approved
```

**Multi-Party Validation**:

1. **Identity Verification**: Sarah validates Marco's credentials and insurance
2. **Capability Check**: System validates Marco's Transport certification
3. **Reputation Assessment**: Sarah reviews Marco's PPR summary:
   - 98% on-time delivery rate
   - 4.8/5 quality score
   - 12 successful transport completions

### **Phase 3: Resource Preparation (Day 3)**

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> Available: CNC Machine Available
    Available --> Reserved: Sarah prepares for transport
    Reserved --> InTransit: Documentation complete, handoff begins

    note right of Reserved
        OperationalState: Available → Reserved → InTransit
        (LifecycleStage stays Active on Layer 0)
        Transport protocols linked
        Insurance certificate uploaded
    end note
```

**Sarah's Preparation**:

1. **Resource State Update**: Changes CNC `OperationalState` from `Available` to `Reserved` (Layer 0 `LifecycleStage` stays `Active`)
2. **Transport Documentation**: Creates transport checklist and safety protocols
3. **Insurance Coordination**: Uploads facility insurance certificate

### **Phase 4: Transport Process (Day 4)**

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Marco as Marco (FabLab)
    participant Sarah as Sarah (Sensorica)
    participant ERP as ERP 
    participant ND as Nondominium
    participant Res as Resource Zome
    participant PPR as PPR System

    Marco->>ERP: Arrive for transport
    ERP->>ND: update_operational_state(InTransit)
    ND->>Gov: Validate Marco's Transport role (validate_specialized_role)
    Sarah->>ERP: Scan QR code on CNC machine
    Marco->>ERP: Scan QR code confirmation
    ERP->>ND: transfer_custody()
    ND->>Res: Update custodian: Sarah → Marco
    Note over ND,Gov: transfer_custody logs the TransferCustody economic event
    Gov->>PPR: issue_participation_receipts()
    PPR-->>ND: Generate bilateral PPRs for both agents
    ND-->>ERP: Update transport status
```

**The Physical Transfer**:

1. **Transport Initiation**: Marco arrives with certified transport equipment
2. **Custody Transfer Ceremony**: Both agents scan QR codes on CNC machine
3. **Multi-Signature Process**: Bilateral cryptographic signatures executed
4. **Real-time Updates**: ERP shows live transport status

### **Phase 5: Usage & Monitoring (Week 1-2)**

```mermaid
graph LR
    subgraph "Usage Process"
        A[Start Use] --> B[Log Daily Usage]
        B --> C[Performance Metrics]
        C --> D[PPR Generation]

        G[ValidationActivity]
        H[TransportFulfillmentCompleted]
    end

    D --> F
    D --> G
    D --> H
```

**Resource Utilization**:

1. **Use Process Activation**: Marco initiates CNC machine for prototype production
2. **Quality Monitoring**: System tracks usage hours and maintenance needs
3. **Progress Reporting**: Daily usage logs through ERP interface
4. **Performance Metrics**: Automatic PPR generation for each use session

### **Phase 6: Return & Completion (Day 15)**

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Marco as Marco (FabLab)
    participant Sarah as Sarah (Sensorica)
    participant ERP as ERP
    participant ND as Nondominium
    participant PPR as PPR System

    Marco->>ERP: Complete maintenance checklist
    ERP->>ND: claim_commitment()
    Marco->>ERP: Initiate return transport
    ERP->>ND: update_operational_state(InTransit)
    Sarah->>ERP: Scan return QR code
    ERP->>ND: transfer_custody()
    ND->>Res: Update custodian: Marco → Sarah
    Sarah->>ERP: Inspect and approve return
    ERP->>ND: validate_specialized_role()
    ND->>Gov: Create validation receipts
    Gov->>PPR: issue_participation_receipts()
    PPR-->>ND: Update reputation scores
    ND-->>ERP: Transaction complete
```

**Return Process**:

1. **Maintenance Check**: Marco performs routine maintenance and documents condition
2. **Return Transport**: Reverse transport with same validation process
3. **Final Assessment**: Sarah inspects returned equipment
4. **Bilateral PPR Issuance**: Both agents receive participation receipts
