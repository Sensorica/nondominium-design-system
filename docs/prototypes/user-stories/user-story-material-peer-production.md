# User Story: peer production (makerspace) - Collaborative Manufacturing

## Scenario: Makerspace Network Producing Custom Equipment Using Nondominium

**Context**: A distributed network of makerspaces collaborates to produce custom scientific equipment for research institutions. **This scenario clearly demonstrates the limitations of Nondominium's resource sharing economics and the critical need for extension (ex. full REA integration with Network Resource Planning (NRP) for complete peer production network management).**

> **How to read this story (grounding note).** Components, designs, and the finished
> sensors are **NDOs**: a permanent Layer 0 `NondominiumIdentity`, a Layer 1
> `ResourceSpecification` carrying quality/IP `GovernanceRule`s (a design shared under
> the `Commons` property regime), and Layer 2 `EconomicResource` instances that move
> between makerspaces via `transfer_custody` (with `OperationalState` cycling
> `Available → Reserved → InTransit → InUse`). Custody handoffs and validations issue
> bilateral **PPRs** from the 16-category set — `ResourceCreation` / `ResourceValidation`
> for contributions, `CustodyTransfer` / `CustodyAcceptance` for component movement,
> `ValidationActivity` and `RuleCompliance` for cross-site QA. Narrative labels like
> `ProductDesign`, `MultiSiteProduction`, and `QualityExcellence` are shorthand for
> these real `ParticipationClaimType` values.
>
> This story is deliberately written to expose where the **MVP stops**: multi-site
> production planning, workflow sequencing, cost accounting, and network-wide
> optimization are **not** Nondominium primitives. They belong to a full REA / NRP
> layer (referred to here as **TrueCommon**, i.e. hREA-based Network Resource
> Planning). Cross-NDO composition is partially served today by `NdoHardLink`
> (`Component` / `DerivedFrom` / `Supersedes`) and `Contribution` / `Agreement`
> entries in `zome_gouvernance`; the rest is post-MVP. Steps against `ND` are the
> ValueFlows/governance zome calls; steps that name planning/workflow/accounting
> functions are TrueCommon/host-platform concerns, not existing zome externs.

### **Production Network Capability Gap Analysis**

| **Capability** | **Nondominium** | **TrueCommon Required** | **Impact on Production Networks** |
|----------------|----------------|------------------------|--------------------------------|
| **Resource Discovery** | ✅ Excellent | - | Foundation layer works well |
| **Access Governance** | ✅ Strong | - | Basic access control sufficient |
| **Reputation Tracking** | ✅ PPR System | - | Individual reputation works |
| **Multi-site Planning** | ❌ Not Available | ✅ NRP Module | **Critical Gap** - Production coordination |
| **Production Workflows** | ❌ Not Available | ✅ Workflow Module | **Critical Gap** - Process management |
| **Cost Accounting** | ❌ Transaction only | ✅ Accounting Module | **Critical Gap** - Financial tracking |
| **Supply Chain** | ❌ Not Available | ✅ Supply Chain Module | **Critical Gap** - Material flow |
| **Quality Management** | ❌ Not Available | ✅ Quality Module | **Critical Gap** - Cross-site QA |
| **Impact Measurement** | ❌ Not Available | ✅ Impact Module | **Critical Gap** - Sustainability |

### **Why Nondominium Alone Cannot Support Production Networks**

**Limitation 1: Bilateral Transaction Focus**
- Nondominium is designed for 1-to-1 resource sharing
- Production networks require N-to-M coordination (multiple facilities, multiple workflows)
- No support for complex multi-party production relationships

**Limitation 2: No Production Planning**
- Resource sharing ≠ production planning
- No capability for capacity planning, bottleneck analysis, or production optimization
- Missing workflow sequencing and dependency management

**Limitation 3: Limited Economic Model**
- Economic events track resource movements, not value creation
- No support for work-in-progress, value-added processes, or production costs
- Missing comprehensive accounting for production networks

**TrueCommon's Network Resource Planning (NRP) bridges these gaps by providing complete REA integration with production-specific capabilities.**
