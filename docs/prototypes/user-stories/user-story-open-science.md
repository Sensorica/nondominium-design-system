# User Story: Open Science - Resource Usage Process

## Scenario: University Research Team Using Shared Laboratory Equipment

**Context**: A university research team needs specialized laboratory equipment for a critical experiment, accessing it through their institutional platform integrated with Nondominium. **This scenario demonstrates Nondominium's capabilities for specialized equipment access, with post MVP capabilities providing enhanced research network coordination and impact measurement.**

> **How to read this story (grounding note).** The shared instrument (CEM-3000) is an
> **NDO**: a permanent Layer 0 `NondominiumIdentity`, a Layer 1 `ResourceSpecification`
> carrying access `GovernanceRule`s (certification, protocol approval, monitoring), and
> a Layer 2 `EconomicResource` instance whose `OperationalState` cycles
> `Available → Reserved → InUse` during the experiment (lifecycle maturity stays on
> Layer 0). Access is a **Use** process: the researcher submits `propose_commitment(AccessForUse)`,
> the custodian evaluates trust via `derive_reputation_summary`, and completion issues
> bilateral **PPRs** from the 16-category set — here `CustodyAcceptance` /
> `CustodyTransfer` for the access grant, `ValidationActivity` and `RuleCompliance`
> for protocol adherence, and (for the custodian's service) the maintenance/service
> categories. Narrative labels like `UseService`, `ServiceValidation`, and
> `CommitmentFulfillment` are shorthand for these real `ParticipationClaimType`
> values. Real-time monitoring, LIMS, and publication tooling are **host-platform**
> concerns; steps against `ND` are the ValueFlows/governance zome calls. Multi-institution
> coordination and impact accounting are **post-MVP** (hREA/NRP).
