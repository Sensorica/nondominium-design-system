# User Story: Artist Distribution - Gallery Network & Exhibition Logistics

## Scenario: Artist Coordinating Multi-Venue Exhibition Tour Through Distributed Gallery Network

**Context**: An artist organizes a traveling exhibition across multiple galleries, alternative venues, and individual patrons, coordinating logistics, artwork transport, and installation through the Artcoin distribution network built on Nondominium.

See also *artcoin_main_doc.md*, *user-story-artcoin.md* and *nondominium_artcoin.md*.

> **How to read this story.** Each artwork in the tour is a **Nondominium Object (NDO)** —
> a permanent `NondominiumIdentity` (Layer 0) whose custody moves between galleries,
> transporters, storers, and patrons via `transfer_custody`. Each hand-off changes the
> instance's `OperationalState` (`InTransit`, `InStorage`, `InUse`) and generates
> bilateral **Private Participation Receipts (PPRs)**. Reputation labels shown in the
> diagrams (e.g. "TouringExcellence") are Artcoin-domain summaries **derived from** the
> real PPR categories (`CustodyTransfer`, `TransportFulfillmentCompleted`,
> `ValidationActivity`, `RuleCompliance`, …). For which capabilities are code-complete
> versus planned (e.g. structured Economic Processes, payment settlement), see
> *nondominium_artcoin.md §5*.

**Gallery Network Formation**:

1. **Venue Selection and Validation**: Five venues selected with complementary characteristics:
   - **Gallery A** (Downtown): Commercial gallery with established collector base
   - **Gallery B** (University): Academic context with educational programming
   - **Gallery C** (Alternative): Community-focused space with local engagement
   - **Gallery D** (Regional): Suburban location with diverse audience
   - **Gallery E** (International): Final venue with exposure to international collectors
2. **Capability Verification**: Each venue's exhibition standards verified:
   - Climate control and environmental monitoring ✅
   - Professional installation capabilities ✅
   - Security and insurance coverage ✅
   - Curatorial alignment and audience engagement ✅
3. **Tour Coordination Agreement**: Smart contract outlines:
   - Conservation standards and artwork handling requirements
   - Installation quality and lighting specifications
   - Tour schedule with buffer time for transport and installation
   - Revenue sharing and commission structures

### **Phase 3: Artwork Preparation & Tour Logistics (Month 2-3)**

**Tour Preparation and Logistics**:

1. **Artwork Conservation Review**: Professional conservator reviews all artworks:
   - Condition assessment and documentation
   - UV protection glass installation for photographs
   - Archival mounting and framing to conservation standards
   - Insurance valuation and risk assessment
2. **Tour Packaging and Documentation**:
   - Custom crates designed for each artwork with climate control
   - Digital condition reporting with before/after documentation
   - Installation specifications and lighting requirements for each piece
   - Complete provenance and exhibition history documentation
3. **Transport Planning**: Climate-controlled transport with:
   - Professional art handlers trained in photography conservation
   - Temperature and humidity monitoring throughout transport
   - GPS tracking and security protocols
   - Insurance coverage for entire tour duration

> **Custody chain note.** Every leg of the tour is a custody transfer. Transporters
> hold the validated `Transport` role and storers the `Storage` role (`REQ-GOV-04`);
> between venues, pieces move to `OperationalState::InTransit` and, during scheduling
> gaps, `OperationalState::InStorage`. Each hand-off emits `CustodyTransfer` /
> `CustodyAcceptance` PPRs plus `TransportFulfillmentCompleted` /
> `StorageFulfillmentCompleted` service PPRs — building the reputation of the support
> agents alongside the artist. A final "venue" may equally be an **individual patron**
> who adopts a piece at the end of the tour.
