# User Story: Food Basket - Last-Mile Logistics Coordination

## Scenario: Cooperative Distribution Network for Local Food Systems

**Context**: A network of local farms and food producers coordinates last-mile delivery to urban customers through a distributed logistics system powered by Nondominium, optimizing routes and sharing delivery resources.

> **How to read this story (grounding note).** Produce batches and shared logistics
> assets (refrigerated vehicles, cold-storage) are **NDOs**: a permanent Layer 0
> `NondominiumIdentity` (`create_ndo`), an optional Layer 1 `ResourceSpecification`
> for the produce type and food-safety `GovernanceRule`s, and a Layer 2
> `EconomicResource` instance (`create_economic_resource`) whose `custodian` and
> `OperationalState` (`Available → Reserved → InTransit → InStorage`) move as the
> basket travels farm → hub → customer. Custody handoffs between producer, hub, and
> courier use `transfer_custody`, which logs a `TransferCustody` economic event and
> issues bilateral **Private Participation Receipts (PPRs)** — here mainly the
> service categories `TransportCommitmentAccepted` / `TransportFulfillmentCompleted`
> and `StorageCommitmentAccepted` / `StorageFulfillmentCompleted`, plus
> `CustodyTransfer` / `CustodyAcceptance`. Route optimization, temperature IoT, and
> payment settlement are **host-platform** responsibilities layered on top of
> Nondominium; steps shown against `ND` are the ValueFlows/governance calls, while
> platform-orchestration steps are illustrative of the surrounding system.
> Multi-producer, N-to-M consolidation is a **post-MVP** many-to-many flow (see
> `documentation/requirements/post-mvp/many-to-many-flows.md`); the MVP models each
> leg as one-to-one custody events.

   - Mixed vegetables: 250 kg total
   - Temperature requirements: 2-4°C throughout delivery
   - Delivery windows: Tuesday and Thursday, 6-9 PM
   - Quality standards: Organic certification, freshness guarantees
2. **Food Safety Setup**: HACCP compliance and temperature monitoring requirements
3. **Batch Tracking**: Lot numbers and timestamps for complete traceability
4. **Distribution Scheduling**: Integration with weekly delivery planning system

### **Phase 2: Route Optimization & Network Coordination (Tuesday Morning)**

```mermaid

    participant James as James Chen
    participant Platform as Distribution Platform
    participant ND as Nondominium
    participant PPR as PPR System
    participant Gov as Governance Zome

    James->>Platform: Review weekly distribution requirements
    Platform->>ND: get_all_ndos() / get_all_economic_resources()
    ND->>Res: Query all registered produce batches for week
    Res-->>ND: Return consolidated resource list

    James->>Platform: optimize_delivery_routes() (host-platform logistics)
    Note over Platform: Route optimization is a platform concern, not a zome call

    James->>ND: derive_reputation_summary(Producers)
    ND->>PPR: Calculate producer reliability scores
    PPR-->>ND: Return producer quality ratings (avg 4.8/5)

    James->>ND: propose_commitment(TransferCustody/AccessForUse) per producer
    ND->>Gov: Generate delivery commitments with all producers
```

**Network Optimization Process**:

1. **Delivery Consolidation**: James reviews all producer delivery needs:
   - 8 producers with 250-400 kg each
   - 150 urban delivery addresses
   - Geographic clustering optimization
2. **Route Planning**: Algorithm optimizes for:
   - Minimum total distance: 127 km reduced to 89 km
   - Temperature maintenance requirements
   - Customer delivery time windows
   - Vehicle capacity constraints
3. **Producer Validation**: All producers verified for food safety compliance and on-time performance
4. **Resource Sharing**: Refrigerated vehicles and bike couriers coordinated across network

### **Phase 3: Multi-Producer Consolidation & Hub Operations (Tuesday Afternoon)**

```mermaid

    [*] --> HarvestComplete: All producers ready
    HarvestComplete --> PickupScheduled: Route optimization complete
    PickupScheduled --> InTransitToHub: First pickup initiated

        Mixed-produce consolidation
    end note
```

**Consolidation & Hub Operations**:

1. **Producer Pickup**: James coordinates pickup sequence to minimize total travel distance
2. **Temperature Verification**: Each pickup scanned for temperature compliance and quality
3. **Hub Processing**: At urban distribution hub:
   - Quality verification for all produce
   - Mixed-produce consolidation for final delivery efficiency
   - Customer order assembly and packaging
   - Final route planning optimization
4. **Blockchain Tracking**: Each produce batch logged with complete temperature and handling history
